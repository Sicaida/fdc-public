   "Question": "Have you received a compliance notification since 2 July 2018?",
   "Answer": "Compliance notifications are sent to providers via the Child Care Subsidy System when a potential breach, e.g. a missed timeframe for submitting a session report, is identified. If a provider receives a compliance notification, they should take the appropriate action to address the issue to ensure they are compliant with their obligations.\nNotifications about potential breaches are monitored by the department, but do not necessarily result in the department taking immediate compliance action. Compliance notifications form part of the department's ongoing monitoring processes and trend analysis.\nThe department will take compliance action when deemed necessary."

   "Question": "What if the cause of the notification was unavoidable?",
   "Answer": "If a compliance notification is generated due to third party software problem, the department will take this into account. In these circumstances, the department in the future may require further information from you regarding the specific occurrence.\nIf you experience third party software issues that might cause a compliance notification to be issued, then you should hold onto the information that shows that the cause was unavoidable."
