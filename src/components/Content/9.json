   "Question": "Where in the Family Assistance Law does it say that there is no eligibility for Child Care Subsidy for a Family Day Care educator who provides care to a child related to them?",
   "Answer": "Subparagraph 85BA(1)(c)(iii) of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 (the Family Assistance Act), states there are circumstances prescribed in the Child Care Subsidy Minister's Rules 2017 (Minister's Rules) when an individual will not be eligible for Child Care Subsidy for a session of care where the care is provided by a Family Day Care educator (or their partner) to a child that is related to the educator or their partner.\nFurther to the Family Assistance Act, subsection 8(3) of the Minister's Rules provides that if the Family Day Care educator provides care to children to whom they are related they are not eligible for Child Care Subsidy if the child is one (or more) of the following with respect to the Family Day Care educator or the partner of the Family Day Care educator:\nFamily Tax Benefit child;\nregular care child;\nfoster care child;\nbiological or adopted child;\nbrother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother or step sister;\na child (not mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (e)) for whom the Family Day Care educator or partner has legal responsibility, as described in paragraph 22(5)(a) or (b) of the Family Assistance Act."

   "Question": "Can a Family Day Care educator still care for extended family under the Family Assistance Law?",
   "Answer": "There are restrictions under the Family Assistance Law about Family Day Care educators providing care for children who are related to them. The Family Assistance Law specifies care that is not eligible for Child Care Subsidy, but does allow for some care to be provided to related children.\nSection 47 of the Minister's Rules provides that within each Child Care Subsidy fortnight, the Family Day Care educator must make sure that less than 50% of children in care are related to them, and that more than 50% of children in care are not related to them.\nThe ratio is applied across all of the children cared for across the whole fortnight, and not to just one particular session.\n"

   "Question": "If a Family Day Care educator is not married to their partner, is their partner's child counted as a relative of the educator?",
   "Answer": "Yes, children that are relatives of a Family Day Care educator's partner must be counted as a relative of the Family Day Care educator. The law treats de-facto relationships in the same way as marital relationships. These partnerships establish familial relationships.\nOn this basis, the relatives of a Family Day Care educator's partner (by de facto or marriage) are considered relatives of the Family Day Care educator. Related children should be treated as prescribed in section 47 of the Minister's Rules if the Family Day Care educator is providing care for them during the Child Care Subsidy fortnight."

   "Question": "What happens if a Family Day Care educator is caring for both related and non-related children in care and meets the 50% rule, but the non-related children then leave? Is there a grace period to allow care to continue to be eligible for Child Care Subsidy for the relatives until new enrolments of non-relative children takes place? If so, how long is the grace period?",
   "Answer": "No, the legislation does not provide for a grace period in these circumstances. The \"care for less than 50% related children\" requirement applies to each Child Care Subsidy fortnight. If a Family Day Care educator has non-related children leave their service, then they still need to maintain the \"care for less than 50% related children\" for each Child Care Subsidy fortnight.\nIn the event that non-related children leave care, the Family Day Care educator should approach their provider and make arrangements to ensure they will provide care for enough non-related children within the current Child Care Subsidy fortnight.\nThis is necessary to comply with section 47 of the Minister's Rules, which provides that within each Child Care Subsidy fortnight the Family Day Care educator must make sure that less than 50% of children in care are related to them, and that more than 50% of children in care are not related to them.\nThe ratio is applied across all of the children cared for across the whole fortnight, and not to just one particular session."
