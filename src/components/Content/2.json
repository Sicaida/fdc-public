   "Question": "Do educators need a working with children check and a national police check or does the working with children check cover the police check?",
   "Answer": "Each state/territory determines who requires a working with children card. In some states, when a working with children card is obtained, a police check is done automatically. In other states, it is not.\nThe process for obtaining a working with children card and some of the terms used in the screening process vary in each jurisdiction so it is important that child care personnel seek advice about how to obtain a working with children card from the relevant regulatory body in their state or territory. Each state or territory will have a different regulatory body responsible for working with children checks.\nAustralian Institute of Family StudiesÂ outlines the screening requirements for the working with children card in each state and territory and provides contact details for the relevant authority."

   "Question": "Will there be additional invoicing functionality?",
   "Answer": "Some third party software providers have already made enhancements to their software products to provide you with additional invoicing functionality.
