   "Question": "Can a foster carer claim the ACCS for a child under their care?\n",
   "Answer": "As part of ACCS (child wellbeing), foster carers may be eligible to receive additional child care fee assistance, depending on their circumstances.\nTo be eligible for an ACCS payment, the foster parent must also meet the general CCS eligibility requirements in relation to the child (i.e. primary carers).  Foster carers must still apply for CCS and a Customer Reference Number (CRN) if they do not have these, and have their CRN linked to the child's.  If a foster carer is caring for a child that is under the care of a state or territory safety/protection agency by way of a court order, the child may be taken to be at risk for the purposes of ACCS (child wellbeing) and no additional evidence needs to be provided (however, a letter will be required from the appropriate state or territory child protection agency each six months confirming that the court order is still in place). Refer to the Guide to ACCS (child wellbeing) (page 14-15) for more information. In circumstances where foster carers are not liable for the child care fees (i.e. the state covers the child care fee costs), they are not eligible for CCS.\nCustomers can contact Centrelink directly on 136 150 regarding their CCS assessment, or view their details online via their myGov account.\nTo determine liability of fees, please see the 'liability to pay' fact sheet.\n"
